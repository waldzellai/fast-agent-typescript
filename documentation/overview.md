## Introduction

The MCP Agent Framework is a robust system designed to facilitate the development, deployment, and management of agent-based applications in TypeScript. It provides a modular architecture for creating intelligent agents that can interact with various services and environments, supporting both local and distributed setups. As part of the transition to TypeScript, all Python scripts in the `scripts/` and `examples/` directories have been successfully converted to TypeScript, ensuring consistency across the project.

## Core Components

The framework consists of several key modules, each serving a distinct role in the system. Below is a brief overview of these components with links to detailed documentation:

- **[MCP Agent](./mcp-agent.md)**: The central module for agent logic and interaction, defined in `src/mcpAgent.ts`.
- **[CLI Interface](./cli.md)**: Command-line tools for managing and interacting with the framework, found in `src/cli.ts`.
- **[Server](./server.md)**: Handles communication and coordination between agents and external systems, located in `src/server.ts`.
- **[Utilities](./utils.md)**: Helper functions and utilities used across the framework, available in `src/utils.ts`.
- **[Core Modules](./core-modules.md)**: Essential building blocks for agent functionality, housed in `src/core/*`.
- **[Entry Point](./entry-point.md)**: The main entry point for the application, defined in `index.ts`.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the MCP Agent Framework is to streamline the creation of autonomous agents capable of performing complex tasks through modular, reusable components. It aims to provide developers with tools to build scalable and maintainable agent systems with minimal overhead.

## Setup and Configuration

To get started with the MCP Agent Framework, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and install dependencies using `npm install`.
2. **Configuration**: Adjust settings in configuration files as needed (refer to individual module documentation for specifics).
3. **Running**: Use the CLI tools or directly run the entry point with `node index.ts` to start the application.

For detailed setup instructions, refer to the respective module documentation linked above.

## Integration

The framework is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing TypeScript projects. Developers can extend agent capabilities by importing and utilizing the provided modules, or by creating custom agents using the core components as a foundation.
